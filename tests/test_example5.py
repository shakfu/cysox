    This is a port of example5.c which demonstrates using memory buffers
    instead of files for audio I/O. We read a file, write to memory,
    then read from memory and write to a file.

    NOTE: Even using sox_open_memstream_write (which allocates its own C buffer),
    the code still crashes during write operations. This suggests libsox's memory I/O
    implementation may not be fully functional or has platform-specific issues.

    Attempted fixes:
    - Fixed filetype string encoding (was corrupting strings)
    - Switched from bytearray to memstream (C-managed buffer)
    - Still crashes at write time
